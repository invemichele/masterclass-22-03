you can copy all the files in this folder into new `subCV-metad` and `subCV-explore` folders for the other tests
first run the `setup.sh` script, to prepare the folders for the independent replicas
then you can run them in parallel with the `run_gromacs.sh` script
remember to properly edit the `plumed.dat` script
