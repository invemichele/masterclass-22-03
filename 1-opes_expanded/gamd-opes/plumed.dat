SIGMA is the standard deviation from an umbiased run

This simulation results in a broad sampling of the energy, that resembles the one obtained with ECV_MULTITHERMAL
Notice that the LOWER_HALF_ONLY keyword is important, and without it the forces are so strong that the system would break.
Also using OPES_METAD on the energy with a flat target distributino (BIASFACTOR=inf) would result in a very unstable simulation.
You can try it yourself!
